Issuer handles sending issues to GitHub with a Pipedream workflow. Bear in mind that any information your users add to the issue report may be visible in
the GitHub issue that is created. At present, this is limited to the title and description.

We do not collect any further information about the user as part of the Pipedream request. The information provided by the browser when making the http
request is visible in Pipedream logs, including the source IP address and user agent. We do not currently aggregate this information.

Section 5 of the [Pipedream privacy policy](https://pipedream.com/privacy) (as at 26th January 2022) states that Pipedream does not use any information
submitted via workflows for any commercial purpose, beyond the needs they have to provide and operate their services.
